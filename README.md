# ForecastProject

It is an app that  download the forecast from website and send it to my email adress in formatted string. There is also an option to send SMS instead of email.

App checks when I start and finish my work (from Google Calendar), downloads data from forecast website (https://pogoda.interia.pl), turn it into formatted string and send me two emails: with forecast for one hour before my shift and with forecast for hour when I finish my shift. I put project into .exe file (using Pyinstaller) so app can start when I run the computer.
